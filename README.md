# DocScanner
This Python application uses Tkinter for a GUI interface and OpenCV for capturing frames from a webcam. It allows users to scan documents by detecting edges, applies perspective transformation, and displays the scanned image. Users can then save the scanned document as a PDF file using ReportLab.

# Key Features:
_GUI: Built with Tkinter for user interaction.
-Image Processing: Uses OpenCV for capturing and processing webcam frames.
-Edge Detection: Identifies document edges using Canny edge detection and contours.
-PDF Creation: Integrates ReportLab to save scanned images as PDF files.
# Usage Instructions:
-Click "Scan Document" to capture and process a frame.
-Adjust document position for optimal scanning.
-Click "Save as PDF" to save the scanned document.
# Dependencies: 
Python (3.x), OpenCV, NumPy, Tkinter, ReportLab.
